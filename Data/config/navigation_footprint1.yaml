#
#  Notation: whether you use Ackerman or Differential chassis,
#            first you need to get the rotation center which mean rear wheel-base center for Ackerman chassis and mean body center for Differential chassis
#            second you need to get the model configuration according the following model definition
#    Footprint Model
#      1) line model:
#           "line start" and "line end" is refer to the rear wheel-base center which is "rotation_center_pose" now
#           "+" mean distance forward to the rear wheel-base center
#      2) two_circles model:
#           "front offset" and "rear offset" is refer to the rear wheel-base center which is "rotation_center_pose" now
#           for front, "+" mean distance forward to the rear wheel-base center
#           for rear, "+" mean distance backward to the rear wheel-base center
#      3) point model:
#           origin refer to body center which is "rotation_center_pose" now
#      4) circle model:
#           origin refer to body center which is "rotation_center_pose" now
#      5) polygon model:
#           origin refer to body center which is "rotation_center_pose" now
#  Be Careful!: for Differential chassis, rotation center is equal to the body center
